This is the supplementary information package of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology paper titled "The Role of Empathy in Software Engineering - A Socio-Technical Grounded Theory" authored by Hashini Gunatilake, John Grundy, Rashina Hoda, and Ingo Mueller.

The study employed a qualitative approach, using Socio-Technical Grounded Theory for data analysis and theory development. We developed a comprehensive theory of empathy in software engineering, framed by the Glaser’s 6Cs model and Strauss and Corbin’s paradigm model. Our findings address the context, conditions, causes, and consequences of empathy, as well as its absence. We also identified strategies (contingencies) for enhancing empathy and explored the relationships (covariances) between these categories.
